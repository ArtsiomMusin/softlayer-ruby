{"name":"Softlayer-ruby","tagline":"A Ruby library that assists in calling the SoftLayer API","body":"[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/softlayer_api.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/softlayer_api)\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/softlayer/softlayer-ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SLsthompson/softlayer-ruby)\r\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/softlayer/softlayer-ruby/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/SLsthompson/softlayer-ruby?branch=master)\r\n\r\n# SoftLayer API for Ruby\r\n\r\nThe softlayer-ruby project creates a [Ruby Gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/softlayer_api) which provides language bindings to the [SoftLayer API](http://sldn.softlayer.com/article/The_SoftLayer_API) for the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) programming language.\r\n\r\nThe heart of the project a foundation layer (represented by the Client and Service classes) that allows SoftLayer customers to make direct calls to the SoftLayer API. The Gem also builds a object heirarchy on top of that foundation which provides an abstract model which insulates scripts from direct dependency on the low-level details of the SoftLayer API.\r\n\r\nMore comprehensive documentation on using the `softlayer_api` Gem, and contributing to the project, may be found by cloning this project and generating the documentation.\r\n\r\n## Generating Documentation\r\n\r\nOnce you have cloned the project, from the main project directory you can generate documentation by installing the bundle and using `rake`:\r\n\r\n    $ cd softlayer-ruby\r\n    $ bundle install\r\n    $ bundle exec rake rdoc\r\n\r\nThis will create a new folder named `doc` inside of the project source and populate it with project documentation. You may then open the documentation file `doc/index.html` in your browser to begin exploring the documentation.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\nThis software is written by the SoftLayer Development Team [sldn@softlayer.com](mailto:sldn@softlayer.com).\r\n\r\nPlease join us in the [SoftLayer Developer Network forums](http://forums.softlayer.com/forum/softlayer-developer-network)\r\n\r\n# Copyright and License\r\n\r\nThe `softlayer_api` Ruby Gem and it's source files are Copyright &copy; 2010-2014 [SoftLayer Technologies, Inc](http://www.softlayer.com/).
