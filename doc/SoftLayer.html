<p>This module is used to provide a namespace for <a
href="SoftLayer.html">SoftLayer</a> code. It also declares a number of
global variables:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>+$SL_API_USERNAME+ - The default username passed by clients to the server
for authentication. Set this if you want to use the same username for all
clients and don&#39;t want to have to specify it when the client is created</p>
</li><li>
<p>+$SL_API_KEY+ - The default API key passed by clients to the server for
authentication. Set this if you want to use the same api for all clients
and don&#39;t want to have to specify it when the client is created</p>
</li><li>
<p>+$SL_API_BASE_URL+- The default URL used to access the <a
href="SoftLayer.html">SoftLayer</a> API. This defaults to the value of
+SoftLayer::API_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT+</p>
</li></ul>
